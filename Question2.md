<< Key Features of Lists in Python >>
## 1 Ordered: Lists maintain the order in which elements were added.
## 2 Mutable: Lists can be modified after creation (e.g., append, insert, delete).
## 3 Indexable: Elements can be accessed by their index (e.g., my_list[0]).
## 4 Dynamic: Lists can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.
## 5 Heterogeneous: Lists can contain elements of different data types (e.g., strings, integers, floats).
## 6 Supports Slicing: Lists can be sliced to extract subsets of elements (e.g., my_list[1:3]).
## 7 Supports Methods: Lists have built-in methods for common operations (e.g., append(), sort(), reverse()).
